MyToken Contract
A Solidity contract for creating and managing a custom token called "kumar" with the abbreviation "ABS".

Description
The MyToken contract is a simple implementation of a custom token on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functions for minting new tokens and burning existing ones, allowing the total supply and individual balances to be managed. The contract provides basic functionalities for token creation, distribution, and destruction.

Getting Started
Installing
To use the MyToken contract, follow these steps:
Ensure you have a Solidity-compatible development environment set up, such as Remix IDE or Truffle.
Copy the MyToken contract code into a new Solidity file (e.g., MyToken.sol).
Executing program
To deploy and interact with the MyToken contract, follow these steps:

Open your Solidity development environment.
Copy and paste the MyToken contract code into a new Solidity file (e.g., MyToken.sol).
Compile the contract.
Deploy the contract to your chosen Ethereum network.
Interact with the contract using the provided functions.
Example commands for Remix IDE:
// Deploy the contract
MyToken myToken = new MyToken();

// Mint tokens to a specific address
myToken.mint("0xYourAddressHere", 100);

// Burn tokens from a specific address
myToken.burn("0xYourAddressHere", 50);

// Check the balance of a specific address
uint balance = myToken.Balance("0xYourAddressHere");
Help
For common problems or issues, consider the following:

Ensure that the address used in the mint and burn functions is valid and has the correct format.
Verify that you have sufficient permissions to deploy contracts on the chosen Ethereum network.
Ensure the balance is sufficient when calling the burn function to avoid errors.
For additional help, consult the documentation or community forums of your chosen development environment.
